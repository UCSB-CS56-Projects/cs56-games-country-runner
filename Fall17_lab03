a) 2D side-scrolling game; player controls a character with arrow keys and space bar, to jump over sheep, slimes, racoons, etc.
There's a menu where you can customize your avatar, choose background, choose difficulty, read instructions, see high scores...
b) As a player character, you can jump over different obstacles/animals in order to accumulate points and advance through different levels.
You can also attack the animals with dual images of your player character to eliminate the obstacles from the screen.
c) Software runs, pulls up menu screen upon run, everything works.
d) Better physics, power-ups, changing maps (backgrounds) with each level change, make it more obvious that you've advanced a level by clearing the screen/getting bigger etc.

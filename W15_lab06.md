##Concerns, Issues, Observations

###README.md
- In the game description, there is mention of a game title screen and intructions. But when the game is ran, they are not present.
- In the game description, there is also mention of scarecrows as enemies. But when game is ran, there are not present.

###Actual Game
- [BUG] Window is resizable and when its resized the game glitches out (already documented in issues).
- [POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] There is no way to play the game again. Your forced to close the game and start it up again.
- The art work can use some work.
- [POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] The hit detection needs some work. 
- Art work does not match JPanel size.

###Build.xml
- Looks fine to us. Does not seem like it needs any clean up, it is very concise.

###Test Coverage
- Looks fine to us.

###Code structure
- Unnecessary file "DS_Store" in repo.
- Some source files have misaligned tab spaces. 
- Every source file is well documented 
- CountryRunnerJPanel might need some refactoring because

###Changes Made
- Changed game background
- Added snail enemy (WIP)
- Added play again option to game over screen
- Added score overlay in game.

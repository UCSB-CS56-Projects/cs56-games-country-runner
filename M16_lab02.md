a. This is a game where the object is to jump over obstacles.

b. As a user I can press play so that I can play the game. As a user I can play the game by jumping over objects. As a user I can press Instructions so that I can see the instructions.

c. This software runs, but does not fulfill all functions in the descriptions. The game starts with a title screen and lets user to select play, high score, instructions, and choose background. When the game plays, two types of obstacles will move towards the user’s character. Uparrow key is used to jump over the obstacles. Choose Background changes the game’s background. 

d. As a user I can press Choose Background so that I can see a list of backgrounds and choose one for the game’s background.  As a user I can press High Scores so that I can see the most recent high scores. As a user I can press play game so that I can choose which level of difficulty I want play the game at.

e. The current readme covers most of information of this game. However, some of the functionalities are actually missing in the game, which should have been commented.

f. The build.xml file does not have any old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed and there are not any targets that need descriptions.

g. Yes the issues are enough for earning 1000 points. The first issue is that the background won’t scroll as it should be, also there no other background objects at different depth to show the game environment better. 

h. Modify the game over screen to show the final score of the game just played. (link: https://github.com/ethanyuwang/cs56-games-country-runner.git) Background does not scroll. (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-country-runner/issues/43) Game is too difficult for new beginners. (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-country-runner/issues/44)
Present list of options to change the background to. (https://github.com/ethanyuwang/cs56-games-country-runner.git)

i. The code is divided into sections for different functionalities of the game, and also different objects/characters. Classes and their methods are organized clear and how they are related can be understood easily. The code overall is precise and well-structured to understand.I would have a very precise description for each file at the very top, and a line or two to explain each class and their methods, to have other programmers to understand the source code easier. 

j. Currently there are JUnit tests to test the Sprites, however expand the coverage we can add more tests for each of the method in the classes.
